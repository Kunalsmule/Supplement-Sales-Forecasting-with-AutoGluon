# Supplement Sales Forecasting with AutoGluon

This notebook demonstrates how to use **AutoGluon Time Series** to forecast supplement sales **Revenue** and **Units Sold** based on historical data and relevant features.

## Notebook Steps

### 1. Installation
Install necessary libraries including `pip`, `setuptools`, `wheel`, `autogluon`, and `uv`.

### 2. Data Loading
Load the supplement sales data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

### 3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Convert the `Date` column to datetime objects.
- Sort the data by date.
- Add an `item_id` column required by AutoGluon Time Series.
- Rename the `Date` column to `timestamp` for compatibility.
- Create lag features for `Revenue` and `Units Sold`.
- Calculate rolling statistics (mean and standard deviation) for `Revenue` and `Units Sold`.
- Extract time-based features (week of year, month, quarter, day of week).
- Create a binary feature indicating if an item is on discount.
- Drop rows with missing values resulting from lag and rolling computations.
- Convert the prepared Data Frame into an AutoGluon Time Series Data Frame.

## Revenue Forecasting
- Initialize a Timeseries Predictor for the `Revenue` target.
- Specify the prediction length (12 weeks) and frequency (`W` for weekly).
- Train the predictor on the prepared time series data.
- Generate revenue forecasts for the next 12 weeks.

---

## Units Sold Forecasting
- Generate future dates for the forecasting horizon.
- Prepare a Data Frame with future covariate values (`Price`, `Discount`, time-based features, and discount flag).
- Initialize a Timeseries Predictor for the `Units Sold` target, including the prepared future covariates.
- Train the predictor on the time series data.
- Generate Units Sold forecasts for the next 12 weeks using the future covariates.

## Visualization

### Revenue Forecast
Plot the historical data and the mean forecast for both metrics using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the trends and predictions.
